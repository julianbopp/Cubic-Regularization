# Cubic-Regularization

Cubic regularization is a class of optimization algorithms that aim to improve the convergence rate
and efficiency of non-linear optimization problems. The purpose of this project is to survey and
analyze various cubic regularization methods and their applications.

Objectives:
- To study the theory and background of cubic regularization methods, including their historical
development, mathematical foundations, and properties.
- To investigate the different types of cubic regularization methods, such as Cubic
Regularization Newton Method, Adaptive Cubic Regularization, and compare their advantages
and disadvantages.
- To evaluate the performance of cubic regularization methods by comparing them with other
optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient method, and
quasi-Newton methods, and assessing their convergence and accuracy.
- To implement selected cubic regularization methods and apply them to two datasets.
